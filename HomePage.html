<H2>What is React Native?</H2>
</div>

<H3> Long story short: React Native is the future! </H3>

<H3>
        Short story long:
        React Native is a framework that Facebook developed to make dev lives better. It is a technology that enables you to create mobile applications that are identical to the ones built with Swift or Java.
        
        The best thing is that with React Native you can build apps for both iOS and Android using just the one coding language.
</H3>



<H2> Advantages </H2>

<H3>
        1. Components. Using the elements is made very easy. It basically merges HTML and JavaScript, so you don’t have to write a lot of code. The same goes for styling them. This might reduce flexibility, but trust us, the debugging process will also shrink.
</H3>

<H3>
        2. Efficient. The development process is quick and easy. By not having to work on the two different platforms, you can focus on just React Native and have awesome results while saving a lot of time.
</H3>

<H3>
        3. Live Recompiling. Every time you change something, this feature enables you to reload the app and see how it works live. You no longer have to recompile the files after each small line of code to see how it works.
</H3>

<H2> Learning React Native </H2>

<H3>
        First of all, you should understand what correctly building a mobile app is. Get familiar with the concept and components of apps.

        Next, go to the official docs and try to understand what each component does.
        
        You can read some books about such as React Native such as Learning React Native: Building Native Mobile Apps with JavaScript which is quite comprehensive. If you read it, you’ll understand React Native better that some of the people who use it.
        
        There’s no point in learning a new technology, language or framework if you don’t use it. And we recommend you start using it right away. As soon as you understand the basics, you should start playing around with it. In the end, you can read and learn as much as you want, but without practice, it will be pointless.
